# NestAznwApi

This is the backend for my personal homepage. The repository is public, because I made this website to demonstrate my skills.
The frontend that is used by this backend can be viewed here: [Frontend repository for this backend](https://github.com/benjaminmilcic/aznw-routes). It is also public.

If you have any hints or questions feel free to write me an email to [benjamin.milcic@gmail.com](mailto:benjamin.milcic@gmail.com).
